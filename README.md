//NEW TODOS
    get rid of the outlines in the button holder divs
    make bottom button holder color the same as the readonly textareas
    change button backgrounds from bootstrap primary to gray



//OLD TODOS
    change ascii on webpage to text in radios
    use min height in css to make cards taller and make textareas always grow (make both cards equal height at the top)
    add question mark tool tips to input, output, and custom encoding box
    on format radio change swap input and output
    change ace editor

    Titles above custom encodings card section: create encoding -> create message -> render output
    the middle title would be create message [encoded/decoded] based on value of radios which will
        be hidden

    Change bind_radios_labels_foolproof function so it takes the radio group name as a param
    instead of having it based off the nth values
