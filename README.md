TODO:

2. trim() does not get rid of spaces in between parts of a string only leading and trailing
    use //s/g regex with replace instead

4. new line character breaks hex encoding
5. use noty.js to notify user of bad actions taken in the website instead of alerts because they are shitty
6. don't trim custom val input, just take first char
